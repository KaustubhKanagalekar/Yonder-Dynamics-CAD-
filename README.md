# Yonder-Dynamics-CAD-

This repository shows all the CAD work I performed for Yonder Dynamics, a Mars rover team at UC San Diego. 

## Science Module Work 
Our objective for the science sub-team was to collect soil samples for the annual URC (University Rover Challenge) and perform testing.

### Design 
My role was to come up with a prototype of a soil collection mechanism and storage (using SolidWorks for CAD and laser cutting/3D printing for manufacturing). 

Initially, I had prototyped a concept of a “carousel wheel” where we would place 16 cuvettes needed for the competition. Cuvettes are small samples that hold soil. We only needed 12 for the competition, but we had four as backup. This was optimally created with enough spacing to fit all the 16 cuvettes with ease. 

I had a large carousel plate and had a lot of spacing and unnecessary area in my first iteration. This created a problem that would not fit in the science module box. In order to fit within the specifications. I reduced the carousel plate’s size (diameter) and brought closer together the cuvette holders and holes until they were optimally placed. From the first iteration to the final iteration, I reduced the diamter by about 35%.

Then, I designed the cuvettes that we were going to use.
I also designed a cuvette holder that would hold the cuvettes in place when they were attached to the carousel plate.

### Manufacturing 
After designing them, I had to manufacture these components. 

I printed the cuvette holders using PLA 3D printing.

I laser-cut the carousel plate using an acrylic sheet with 0.25 inch thickness.  
Here is the final version of the plate that was placed in the science module-
