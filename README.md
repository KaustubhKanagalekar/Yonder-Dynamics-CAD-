# Yonder-Dynamics-CAD-

This repository shows all the CAD work I performed for Yonder Dynamics, a Mars rover team at UC San Diego. 

## Science Module Work 
Our objective for the science sub-team was to collect soil samples for the annual URC (University Rover Challenge) and perform testing.

My role was to come up with a prototype of a soil collection mechanism and storage (using SolidWorks for CAD and laser cutting/3D printing for manufacturing). 

Initially, I had prototyped a concept of a “carousel wheel” where we would place 12 cuvettes needed for the competition. Cuvettes are small samples that hold soil.This was optimally created with enough spacing to fit all the 12 cuvettes with ease. This wheel would also hold three small cups that were also needed for the science experiments. 

Then, I designed the cuvettes that we were going to use. 

I also designed a cuvette holder that would hold the cuvettes in place when they were attached to the carousel plate.
