# Yonder-Dynamics-CAD-

This repository shows all the CAD work I performed for Yonder Dynamics, a Mars rover team at UC San Diego. 

## Science Module Work 
Our objective for the science sub-team was to collect soil samples for the annual URC (University Rover Challenge) and perform testing.

My role was to come up with a prototype of a soil collection mechanism and storage. 

Initially, I designed the cuvettes (small samples holding soil) that we were going to use. 


Then, I had prototyped a concept of a “carousel wheel” where we would place 12 cuvettes needed for the competition. This was optimally created with enough spacing to fit all the 12 cuvettes with ease.

I also designed a cuvette holder that would hold the cuvettes in place when they were attached to the carousel plate.
